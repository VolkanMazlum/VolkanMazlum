### 🧠 About Me

I am a Master's graduate at **Politecnico di Milano**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. My academic journey stands at the intersection of biological intelligence and computational systems.

With a background in **Computer Engineering**, a Double Major in **Mathematics**, and a Minor in **Psychology**, I aim to combine the biological neural mechanisms and artificial neural networks that we can call it as a (**NeuroAI**).

* 🔭 **Currently working on:** Biologically inspired controllers and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).
* 🌱 **Deepening my knowledge in:** Computational Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures.
* 🎓 **Education:** M.Sc. in CS & Engineering (Polimi) | B.Sc. in Computer Engineering & Mathematics (Cankaya Univ).
